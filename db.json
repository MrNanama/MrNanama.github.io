Let's focus on \\(n \\in \\Z^+\\).\n\nNotice that \\(n = a^2+b^2 = (a+bi)(a-bi)\\), which is a factorization in \\(\\Z[i]\\). Consider primes of \\(\\Z\\).\n\nProposition: If \\(p \\in \\Z\\), is a prime in \\(\\Z\\) but not in \\(\\Z[i]\\), then there exists \\(a,b \\in \\Z\\) such that \\(a^2+b^2 = p\\).\n\nProof: Since \\(p\\) isn't prime in \\(\\Z[i]\\), let \\(p = \\alpha\\beta\\) for non-units \\(\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\Z[i]\\). Then let \\(\\alpha = a+bi\\) and \\(\\beta = c+di\\) for \\(a,b,c,d \\in \\Z\\). Notice that \\(a\\neq0,b\\neq0,c\\neq0,d\\neq0\\), as otherwise \\(p\\) wouldn't be prime in \\(\\Z\\). Also, \\(p = ac-bd+(ad+bc)i\\). Since \\(p \\in \\Z\\), \\(ad+bc = 0\\). Furthermore, let \\(h = \\gcd(a,b)\\). Then \\(p = h(a'+b'i)(c+di)\\) where \\(a = a'h\\) and \\(b = b'h\\). Then let \\((a'+b'i)(c+di)=e+fi\\), since \\(p = h(e+fi)=he+hfi\\), we have \\(f = 0\\). For the sake of contradiction, assume \\(h\\) is not a unit. Furthermore, since \\(a,b,c,d \\neq 0\\), \\((a'+b'i)(c+di)\\) is not a unit. Therefore, \\(p\\) isn't prime which leads to a contradiction. Hence \\(h = \\pm 1\\), since \\(h = \\gcd(a,b)\\) we have \\(h = 1\\), so \\(a,b\\) are coprime. The same argument applies to \\(c\\) and \\(d\\). Remember that \\(ad+bc = 0\\) which implies \\(ad = -bc\\). By the fundamental lemma, it's easy to see that \\(a\\mid c\\) and \\(c \\mid a\\) while \\(b \\mid d\\) and \\(d \\mid b\\). So \\(c = \\pm a\\) and \\(d = \\pm b\\). If \\(c=a\\) and \\(d=b\\), or \\(c=-a\\) and \\(d=-b\\) then \\(ad=-bc\\) doesn't hold. Therefore, either \\(a=-c\\) or \\(d = -b\\). If \\(a=-c\\) and \\(d=b\\) then \\(p = (a+bi)(-a+bi)= -a^2-b^2 <0\\), so the only option left is \\(a=c\\) and \\(d = -b\\). Therefore, \\(p = (a+bi)(a-bi)=a^2+b^2\\).\n\nNow the question is, what primes \\(p\\) are prime in \\(\\Z[i]\\). Since \\(\\Z[i]\\) has the fundamental lemma, \\(p\\) is prime in \\(\\Z[i]\\) iff \\(\\Z[i]_p\\) is a domain. Then \\(p\\) is prime iff \\({\\Z[x]_{x^2+1}}_p\\) is a domain, therefore, \\({\\Z[x]_p}_{x^2+1}\\) is a domain, therefore \\(x^2+1\\) is prime in \\(\\Z[x]_p\\). This is equivalent to checking if \\(x^2+1 = 0 \\mod p\\) has a solution. Which is evaluating whether \\(-1\\) is a quadratic residue in \\(\\mod p\\). Here we won't use quadratic reciprocity or any legendre symbol techniques because what we'll do feels more wholesome. Notice that if \\(x^2+1 = 0\\) then \\(x^4-1 = 0\\). So \\((x^2+1)(x^2-1)=0\\). If \\(-1 \\neq 1 \\mod p\\), then \\(x^2-1 \\neq 0\\). This exception is the case where \\(p=2\\), but we can already see that \\(2 = (1+i)(1-i)=1^2+1^2\\), so we can consider odd primes. Then \\(x \\neq 1\\), \\(x^2 \\neq 1\\) but \\(x^4 =1\\), so \\(ord_p(x)=4\\). So \\(p\\) is not prime in \\(\\Z[i]\\) iff there exists an element of order \\(4\\) in \\(\\Z_p\\). Since \\(\\Z_p\\) is cyclic, let \\(u\\) be a generator of \\(\\Z_p\\). Then there exists element s.t. \\(u^{4k} = 1\\) where \\(u^{2k} \\neq 1\\) and \\(u^k \\neq 1\\). If \\(u^{4k}=1\\), then \\(\\varphi(p) \\mid 4q\\) so \\(p-1 \\mid 4k\\) and \\(p = 4k+1\\). Notice that this is a necessity criteria, so all primes of the form \\(p=4k+3\\) are primes in \\(\\Z[i]\\). Furthermore, let's show that this suffices as well. Let \\(p-1 = 4k\\), since \\(ord_p(u)=p-1=4k\\), we have \\(u^k \\neq 1\\) and \\(u^{2k} \\neq 1\\). Therefore, all primes of form \\(p = 4k+1\\) and \\(2\\) aren't primes in \\(\\Z[i]\\).\n\nFurthermore, notice that numbers \\(n \\in \\Z\\) where \\(n = a^2+b^2\\) for some \\(a,b \\in \\Z\\) are closed under multiplication. As if \\(n = (a+bi)(a-bi)\\) and \\(m = (c+di)(c-di)\\) then \\(nm =(a+bi)(c+di)(a-bi)(c-di)((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i)((ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i)=(ac-bd)^2+(ad+bc)^2\\). So any \\(n = \\prod_{p \\equiv 1,2 \\mod 4} p^{\\alpha}\\) can be expressed as \\(a^2+b^2\\). Consider the more general case, where \\(n = \\prod_{i} p_i^{\\alpha_i}\\) where \\(p_k \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) for some \\(k\\). Suppose \\(n = (a+bi)(a-bi)\\). Define \\(v_p(\\alpha)\\) as the exponent of \\(p\\) in \\(\\alpha\\)'s factorization, notice that we can do this because \\(\\Z[i]\\) is a UFD. Furthermore, \\(v_p(a+bi)=v_p(a-bi)\\) as if there exists \\(\\rho \\in \\Z[i]\\) s.t. \\(p^{k}*\\rho = a+bi\\) then \\(p^k*\\overline{\\rho}=a-bi\\). Therefore, \\(v_p(n)=v_p((a+bi)(a-bi))=v_p(a+bi)+v_p(a-bi)=2v_p(a+bi)\\). So if \\(v_p(n)\\) is odd for some prime \\(p = 4k+3\\), then \\(n\\) cannot be written in form \\(a^2+b^2\\). Furthermore, it's easy to show that if \\(v_p(n)\\) is even, \\(n = a^2+b^2\\) as we've shown that such numbers are closed under multiplication and \\(p^{2k}=(p^k)^2 + 0^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is all \\(n\\) such that \\(n = 2^{\\alpha} * \\prod_{p\\equiv 1 \\mod 4} p_i^{\\beta_i} * \\prod_{p \\equiv 3 \\mod 4} p_i^{2\\gamma_i}\\)\n"},

Many had lost their boots,\nBut limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;\nDrunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots\nOf gas-shells dropping softly behind.\n\nGas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling\nFitting the clumsy helmets just in time,\nBut someone still was yelling out and stumbling\nAnd flound’ring like a man in fire or lime.—\nDim through the misty panes and thick green light,\nAs under a green sea, I saw him drowning.\n\nIn all my dreams before my helpless sight,\nHe plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.\n\nIf in some smothering dreams, you too could pace\nBehind the wagon that we flung him in,\nAnd watch the white eyes writhing in his face,\nHis hanging face, like a devil’s sick of sin;\nIf you could hear, at every jolt, the blood\nCome gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,\nObscene as cancer, bitter as the cud\nOf vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—\nMy friend, you would not tell with such high zest\nTo children ardent for some desperate glory,\nThe old Lie: Dulce et decorum est\nPro patria mori.\n\nCommentary:\nIt's a nice poem. The imagery is strong. In my interpretation, I didn't kill the soldier, he's just suffering a serious damage from the gas. This feels much more cruel and demeaning.\n"},
        {"id":2, "title": "Alone",  "author": "Edgar Allan Poe", "content":"From childhood’s hour I have not been\nAs others were—I have not seen\nAs others saw—I could not bring\nMy passions from a common spring—\nFrom the same source I have not taken\nMy sorrow—I could not awaken\nMy heart to joy at the same tone—\nAnd all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—\nThen—in my childhood—in the dawn\nOf a most stormy life—was drawn\nFrom ev’ry depth of good and ill\nThe mystery which binds me still—\nFrom the torrent, or the fountain—\nFrom the red cliff of the mountain—\nFrom the sun that ’round me roll’d\nIn its autumn tint of gold—\nFrom the lightning in the sky\nAs it pass’d me flying by—\nFrom the thunder, and the storm—\nAnd the cloud that took the form\n(When the rest of Heaven was blue)\nOf a demon in my view—\n\nCommentary:\nMy only problem is that I sense and hear a conceited poet. It makes it much harder to join and share the experience of feeling lonely, but Poe decided to stay alone in his experience and leave the reader in the same state as such. Simplifying feeling lonely and yet treating it in a complex manner augments the experience. Rilke's suggestion with embracing solitude was to leave yourself to art, literature etc. and Poe helps the reader embrace it in solitude in the second part. \n"},
        {"id":4,"title": "Going Blind",  "author": "Rainer Maria Rilke", "content":"She sat just like the others at the table.\nBut on second glance, she seemed to hold her cup\na little differently as she picked it up.\nShe smiled once. It was almost painful.\n\nAnd when they finished and it was time to stand\nand slowly, as chance selected them, they left\nand moved through many rooms (they talked and laughed),\nI saw her. She was moving far behind\n\nthe others, absorbed, like someone who will soon\nhave to sing before a large assembly;\nupon her eyes, which were radiant with joy,\nlight played as on the surface of a pool.\n\nShe followed slowly, taking a long time,\nas though there were some obstacle in the way;\nand yet: as though, once it was overcome,\nshe would be beyond all walking, and would fly.\n\nCommentary:\nIt's a very ambiguous poem. Is it praising the blind lady or pitying her? What does blind mean, is it literally or is there an additional figurative layer? What are they doing, why is the lady there? And these aren't questions from lack of context and all lead to different interpretations for a rich self discussion. Rilke reflects his perspective on art really well here: the reader has to be ripe enough to dig the beauty out of the beautiful. Imagery is strong playful as well.\n"}
